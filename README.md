This project is a Java-based Flashcard Quiz Application that helps users study and review material through interactive digital flashcards. It is designed with an object-oriented structure to facilitate easy extension, customization, and maintenance, originally made for a class project!

Features

Flashcards:

The Card class stores a question and its answer.

MultipleChoiceCard extends Card to support multiple-choice options with one correct answer.

Deck Management:

Deck manages collections of cards, supporting operations like adding, removing, and shuffling.

Decks can contain both regular and multiple-choice cards.

User Performance:

UserPerformanceComparator compares user results, allowing performance tracking and ranking.

Useful for analyzing progress across study sessions.

Testing:

ProjectOneTester provides automated testing for cards, decks, and performance tracking.

Objectives

Practice object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

Gain experience working with Java collections to manage dynamic sets of flashcards.

Implement comparators and sorting logic to evaluate performance.

Build a modular design that can be expanded into a larger study tool.

Possible Extensions

Add a GUI (Java Swing) for an interactive experience.

Implement file I/O to save and load custom decks.

Create timed quizzes or adaptive difficulty modes.

Provide statistics or visualizations for performance over time.
